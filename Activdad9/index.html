            <p> What Is The Cosmere?
                Think the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but for Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy books. Many of the author’s
                novels take place in a shared universe and tell stories of the people and civilizations of that
                universe’s planets. Many Cosmere fans expect these worlds to discover one another (or be united by a
                mysterious force) in an Avengers-style crossover series. </p>

        <p>Autor Brandon Sanderson</p>
        <p> 1: Mistborn Era 1
            The first Mistborn trilogy has it all. A balanced and relatable main character. A ragtag, quip-filled heist
            crew. A powerful tyrant. A well-defined magic system. A crisis of faith. Stunning action sequences.
            Horrifically deformed magical beings. A cute doggy.

            Mistborn (called The Final Empire in some markets) and its sequels—The Well of Ascension and The Hero of
            Ages—pack a combined punch that rivals the best fantasy trilogies out there. We follow Vin as she blossoms
            from decaying street-dweller to capable and confident protagonist. Her journey, spurred by the marvelous
            characters peppered throughout the trilogy, make this our easy first pick for Cosmere rookies.

            Mistborn era one is a fun, self-contained tale that still has Cosmere-spanning impacts. It’s easy to latch
            onto, and the three-book narrative will please plenty of longtime fantasy readers.

            Dip your toe into the world of ash and mist, get familiar, then strap the hell in for twists and turns that
            have Cosmere-spanning implications. </p>
